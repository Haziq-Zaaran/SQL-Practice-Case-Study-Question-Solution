# Practical SQL Case Study  

## Overview  
This repository showcases a collection of practical SQL scenarios designed to address common real-world problems. From identifying duplicate records to fetching specific trends from data, these queries are tailored to illustrate advanced SQL techniques such as window functions, ranking, grouping, and pattern recognition.

## Case Studies and Solutions  

### 1. **Finding Duplicate Records**  
Fetch all duplicate records from a `users` table using window functions.  
**Key Techniques:** `RANK()`, `PARTITION BY`  
**Problem Statement:** Identify entries with the same user name.  

### 2. **Fetching the Second Last Record**  
Retrieve the second last record from an `employee` table.  
**Key Techniques:** `ROW_NUMBER()`, `ORDER BY DESC`  
**Problem Statement:** Rank employees in reverse order to extract the required data.  

### 3. **Highest and Lowest Salaries by Department**  
Display employees earning the highest and lowest salaries in each department.  
**Key Techniques:** `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `PARTITION BY`  
**Problem Statement:** Highlight salary extremes for better HR insights.  

### 4. **Doctors in the Same Hospital but Different Specialities**  
List doctors who work in the same hospital but belong to different specialties.  
**Key Techniques:** `JOIN`, `NOT EQUAL` conditions  
**Problem Statement:** Detect inter-departmental collaborations within hospitals.  

### 5. **Consecutive Logins**  
Identify users who logged in 3 or more times consecutively.  
**Key Techniques:** `LEAD()`, `CASE`, and pattern recognition  
**Problem Statement:** Spot repetitive user behavior for analysis.  

### 6. **Detecting Cold Streaks**  
Fetch records of extremely cold temperatures (<0Â°C) sustained for 3 or more consecutive days in `London`.  
**Key Techniques:** `LEAD()`, `LAG()`, `CASE`  
**Problem Statement:** Analyze weather anomalies.  

### 7. **Top 2 Accounts by Unique Monthly Patients**  
Identify the top 2 accounts with the highest number of unique patients each month.  
**Key Techniques:** `DISTINCT`, `RANK()`, `GROUP BY`  
**Problem Statement:** Recognize accounts with significant activity to prioritize operations.  

## Highlights  
- Each query is paired with a complete table structure and sample data for easy testing.
